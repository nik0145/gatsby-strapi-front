B&Bs \"are more intimate, with much more personal attention,\" says Sharon Scruggs, who operates the Fife and Drum Inn with her husband, Billy. Both are lifetime residents of Williamsburg, Virginia, and provide a unique and in-depth perspective on the history of the area for their guests. The bed-and-breakfast experience offers many other benefits beyond what travelers find in a chain- hotel setting.\n"}},{"node":{"id":"Article_2","image":{"id":"/home/kolya/pet-project/gatsby-strapi-front/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/44d45ff5daf9969c8bf669562aa61398.jpg absPath of file","childImageSharp":{"id":"7bbe2bfe-151f-5b47-ae16-6ec95b98c889","fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":900,"height":500,"src":"/static/b176dbf312059e58223057d05f96f1eb/c0236/44d45ff5daf9969c8bf669562aa61398.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b176dbf312059e58223057d05f96f1eb/c0236/44d45ff5daf9969c8bf669562aa61398.jpg 1x"}}},"title":"Adventure Time, Finn & Jake are playing in a game","content":"It’s hard to believe that 2017 is more than halfway over and that fall is in the air. With that, life starts to speed up as kids head back to school, holidays loom just around the corner, and you may find yourself traveling for work a bit more in the coming months as companies try to wrap up end-of-the-year projects.\n\nWelcome to real travel. What does that mean exactly? While we would all like to plan trips to exotic locations for weeks at a time, the truth is that people travel for life reasons, such as visiting relatives, meeting with clients, and for children’s sports. Just because these types of trips are practical does not mean they can’t also be enjoyable. And one travel blogger has some ideas on how to inject some fun into your real life trips.\n\nDanielle Smith, wife, mother, and creator of the Pretty Extraordinary website, \"A place where you can ditch perfection, embrace the juggle and come away celebrating the small victories,\" believes there are some simple ways to get the best out of real travel.* \n"}}]}},"pageContext":{}}}
